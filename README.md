# Weather-App
Android Studio Project

The Weather-App project is an Android application that retrieves the device's location coordinates (longitude and latitude) and sends this data to an API using an API key. The API returns a JSON response from which we extract the required data, such as the temperature and city of the location.

To make the Weather-App work, we need to request three permissions from the system:
- Coarse Location: `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>`
- Fine Location: `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>`
- Internet: `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>`

To retrieve the JSON data, we use the Volley Library, which is an HTTP library that simplifies networking in Android apps. Add `implementation com.android.volley:volley:1.1.1` to the Gradle app file.

Here is an overview of the Weather-App project:
- We have already generated an API key and obtained the location coordinates.
- We make a request to the API using the URL provided to retrieve the weather data.
